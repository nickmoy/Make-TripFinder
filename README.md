# Make/TripFinder
Implementations of Make and a map Trip Finder as part of UC Berkeley's CS 61B Data Structures course. The majority of these projects
were provided as skeleton code by [Professor Hilfinger](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/hilfinger.html). Most of the code I wrote
was small modifications to this skeleton code as well as the full implementations of the pathfinding algorithms (BFS and DFS using different types of queues).
